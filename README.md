# Tumblr-Reblog-Bot.
(This code is super messy and based of something I found on pastebin)

Requires Pytumblr (https://github.com/tumblr/pytumblr)

##pip install Pytumblr

Simply add your keys and tags and change the CHANGEME.tumblr.com to your tumblr blog url (dont put and www. or http)

posts.txt will store the rebloged post so you dont just reblog the same post.
